# long_gap dataset audit

Status: **passed**.

200 learners; 24 validation categories passed.

| Split | Learners | Events | Responses (including retries) | Eligible practice targets | Eligible assessment targets |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| test | 200 | 151840 | 40961 | 24909 | 3333 |

Training learners' assessment outcomes are retained in raw assessment files for audit only; they are absent from model fitting exports.

## Delayed outcomes (descriptive)

| Partition/delay | Eligible | Full successes |
|---|---:|---:|
| test/1d | 1108 | 438 |
| test/7d | 1105 | 397 |
| test/30d | 1120 | 242 |

## Interpretation

Internal consistency of synthetic data, not human fidelity or model effectiveness.

Independent branches share a learner's practice history; they are correlated, not extra independent learners. No training or PPO effectiveness result is reported.
